# Alibabot Site
For context, this site started as an desktop app to interact with a chatbot, made with python and the OpenAI APIs, but later it switched for this website, where you can download the said app. You can check the code for the desktop app in [this link](https://github.com/CaioEmPessoa/python-chatbot).

## What this site does?
For the users, the website is used only to download and keep track of changes in the chatbot app. But for us, it was a study of SQL to create tables with the users login info, PHP to acess them and many other things.

## How it does?
The site uses PHP and SQL for backend, and for frontend mainly javascript and scss.

To download the app you simply create an account and click on "Download":
